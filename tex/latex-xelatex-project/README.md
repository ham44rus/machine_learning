### Notes:
- Ensure that you have the fonts you want to use installed on your system.
- You can add more packages as needed for your project, depending on your requirements (e.g., graphics, tables, etc.).
- If you want to include other languages, you can modify the `\setdefaultlanguage` command and add the necessary language packages.
